## Project Description 
Color Theory - a browser-based tool coded in React using JavaScript and CSS.

This project is a color scheme generator. With a brief education on the science of Color Theory for each of the main schemes, users can generate a personalized scheme by selecting their favorite color and reveal the complimentary, quadratic, monochromatic, anologous, and triadic palettes. Great for web design!
